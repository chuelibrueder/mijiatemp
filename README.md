# MijiaTemp string resources for translation

This project has the strings for the **MijiaTemp app** (get it from
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smrtprjcts.mijiabt) or
from [Aptoide](https://mijiatemp.en.aptoide.com/app)).

If you would like to improve an existing translation, please do it on github.

If you would like to create a new translation, you can choose from these methods:

## POEditor method
POEditor has a 1000 strings limit. [Join to translate project.](https://poeditor.com/join/project/aBfzBj2DX6)

## Git method

Clone this repository or download the necessary XMLs (e.g. the default English) and translate them (see the values/ directory).

Steps: 
* Create a directory (values-\<lang\>) for the new translation e.g. values-hu for Hungarian, values-de for German, etc. The correct language code can be found in the ISO639-1 column [there](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php).
* Copy the available values directory content to your new directory. Translate the texts between > and < chars. Please pay attention to the special characters ( > < \n \" %s %.f etc) because non-proper strings can cause crashes.  

P.S.: English strings are always up-to-date, that would be the better choice for translation. 

Thanks for helping!
